# CookorDie
Most food budgeting apps are tedious and clunky. They usually involve a lot of work from the users which include manually plugging in ingredients. Cook or Die is a food app that uses a clean picture oriented interface that takes the work out of logging in ingredients. It comes with a preestablished list of ingredients represented by pictures. Simply click on a picture to log what is in your inventory. 
Once you have your inventory logged out you can get recipes based on your inventory.
This will allow the users to plan their meals in advanced and have fun doing it.
